# 题目
Boudreaux and Thibodeaux aren‘t very good at math, so they need you to write a program that can determine the second degree polynomial used to generate a given sequence of three integers. As proof that you’ve figured out the polynomial, they want your program to print out the next <tt>3</tt> integers in the sequence.

You know that each sequence is generated by a polynomial of the form <tt>f(x) = Ax<sup>2</sup> + Bx + C</tt> , where <tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>, and <tt>C</tt> are integers in the range (<tt>-10<sup>3</sup> ≤ (A, B, C) ≤ 10<sup>3</sup></tt>). You are given the values <tt>f(0), f(1), f(2)</tt> and are to determine the values <tt>f(3), f(4), f(5)</tt> .

Input:

Input to this problem will consist of a (non-empty) series of up to <tt>100</tt> data sets. Each data set will be formatted according to the following description, and there will be no blank lines separating data sets.

Each data set consists of a single line containing the space-separated integer values of the polynomial evaluated at <tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>, and <tt>2</tt> (in that order). These values will be in the range (<tt>-10<sup>3</sup> ≤ ( f(0), f(1), f(2) ) ≤ 10<sup>3</sup></tt>).

Output

For each data set, there will be exactly one line of output containing the space-separated integer values of the polynomial evaluated at <tt>3</tt>, <tt>4</tt>, and <tt>5</tt> (in that order). These values will be in the range (<tt>-10<sup>4</sup> ≤ ( f(3), f(4), f(5) ) ≤ 10<sup>4</sup></tt>).

# 参考答案
```c++
  #include <iostream>
using namespace std;	
int main()
{
	double f0,f1,f2,a,b,c,x,y,z;
	while(cin>>f0>>f1>>f2)
	{
		c=f0;
		a=((f2-f0)-(f1-f0)*2)/2;
		b=f1-a-c;
		x=9*a+3*b+c;
		y=16*a+4*b+c;
		z=25*a+5*b+c;
		cout<<x<<' '<<y<<' '<<z<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
